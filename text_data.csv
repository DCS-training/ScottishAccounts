'even below the mountains, heath is the prevailing ap- pearance, excepting where the ground has been in tillage, or immediately upon the shore, where there is some very fine natural grass.  the ground is in general adapted to the  breeding and feeding of black cattle and sheep, and is uni- versally applied to that purpose, excepting the grain which the inhabitants raise for their own use.     population and condition of the people.-there are 770 in the parish, and of these about 300 are in the village.  the annual number of births is 18.  the number of deaths cannot be so well ascertained, as it is but of late years that a register of them was kept at all, and even that not accurate- ly, and the marriages still less.  the marriages, as would be expected, from the situation and habits of life of the peo- ple in the country, are, in general, prolisic.  instances are to be met with of a woman bearing fourteen children to one  husband.  the average of births to each mar- riage may be taken at six.  the inhabitants are lodged       vol. i. o  "
